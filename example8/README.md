let's look at some basic example of nesting decorators, something like

```
loggerDecorator(metricDecorator(function))
```
_"A function that is decorated by a metric decorator which in turn is decorated by a decorator for logging things."_

this should get me slowly accustomed to building up the "onion" :)
