# example3

let's try decorating a method function ..

in this example, the `somedata` struct simply has one value, that's a `string`, this struct has a method attached, called `printSomething`, let's assume we want to 
decoreate that function... 

what (to me) seemed confusing is the fact that you don't really have to care about the function's receiver (which makes it a method of `somedata`) and instead all you
really do care about is the "plain" function's signature of `func()`...

take a look .. maybe leave some comments ..
